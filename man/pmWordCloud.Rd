\title{PubMed wordcloud using function 'plotWordcloud' of package {GOsummaries}}
\usage{
pmWordCloud(abstracts, rot.per = 0.3, max_min = c(1, 0.1), scale = 0.2,
  min.freq = 1, max.words = Inf, random.order = FALSE,
  colors = colSets(type = "Accent"), random.colors = TRUE,
  algorithm = c("circle", "leftside", "rightside"), tryfit = TRUE,
  dimensions = unit(c(1, 1), "npc"))
}
\arguments{
\item{abstracts}{output of cleanAbstracts, or a data frame with one colume of 'word' and one colume of 'freq'.}

\item{rot.per}{proportion words with 90 degree rotation}

\item{max_min}{relative scales to adjust the size difference between largest and smallest word, by default the largest word is written with 10 times as large font than the smallest}

\item{scale}{a fraction of the available space on figure that will be covered with the bounding boxes of words}

\item{min.freq}{words with frequency below min.freq will not be plotted}

\item{max.words}{Maximum number of words to be plotted. least frequent terms dropped}

\item{random.order}{plot words in random order. If false, they will be plotted in decreasing frequency}

\item{colors}{vector of colors fro the words. This vector will be extrapolated into as many colors as needed, starting with the first color for lower frequencies and ending with last color for higher frequencies.}

\item{random.colors}{if true, assigns random color for the words.}

\item{algorithm}{algorithm to find positions of words possible values: "circle", "leftside" and "rightside".}

\item{tryfit}{if TRUE the algorithm checks if all words fit to the figure, if not it tries gradually smaller values of scale parameter until everything fits}

\item{dimensions}{a two element vector of units giving the width and height of the word cloud respectively}
